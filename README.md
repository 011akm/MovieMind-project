## OBjectives 
The Movie Rating Prediction project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about Indian movies. The dataset includes details like movie name, year, duration, genre, rating, votes, director, and three main actors. The data will be used to build a predictive model for movie ratings and extract valuable insights from the movie industry.

## Data Understanding
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: [IMDb India Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)     

The dataset has the following columns:

``Name``: Movie name   
``Year``: release year of the movies   
``Duration``: Movie duration   
``Genre``: Movie genre    
``Rating``: Movie rating    
``Votes``: Number of votes received    
``Director``: Movie director   
``Actor 1``: First main actor    
``Actor 2``: Second main actor    
``Actor 3``: Third main actor   

## Data Cleaning and Transformations
Performing data cleaning like removing the columns where a lot of missing values are there.Also filling the missing valuse with appropriate data.
Doing data transformations like converting columns where string value is given into numeric data.Transformation is essential for a predictive model. 
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights and a predictive model for movie rating prediction. The film industry can benefit from these findings to make data-driven decisions regarding movie production, casting, and marketing. The most influential factors identified are the year of release, the number of votes, and movie duration.
